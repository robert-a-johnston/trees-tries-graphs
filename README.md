#GRAPH NOTES
- Graph
  - a data structure with nodes, vertices, edges
- How to represent graph in code
  - determined by time/space complexity (big O)

  - Set up two arrays
    - array 1 vertices = [a,b,c]
    - array 2 edges = [[a,b], [a,c] ..]
    - time complexity to find adjacent nodes or two nodes are connected
      - O(e) e = number of edges
    - Space complexity 
      - O(v + e) v = number of edges
